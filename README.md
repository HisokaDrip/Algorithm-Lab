# Pathfinding Portfolio 
Two interactive Python applications built with Pygame to visualize and teach pathfinding algorithms.

###  Algo-Race 
A robust grid engine capable of running 50+ algorithm variations (A*, Dijkstra, BFS, DFS).
*   **How it works:** Left-click to draw walls, `SPACE` to run, and `A`/`H` to swap algorithms/heuristics.
*   **Key Feature:** Visualizes exactly how different algorithms scan grids and find the shortest path.

###  Algo-Tutor 
An interactive educational tool designed to explain the math behind the code.
*   **Simulations:** Watch live animations of BFS (Flood fill) vs DFS (Snake-like) scanning.
*   **Math Sandbox:** Drag start/end nodes to visually see how Manhattan vs Euclidean distance is calculated.

**Installation:** Ensure you have Python installed, run `pip install pygame`, and launch the scripts!
